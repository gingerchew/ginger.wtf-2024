Everyone has their favorite web blog. Maybe it was the first one they found on google, or it is another dev's personal blog, or a collection of writers that all post about web dev.

When I first became a developer, I thrived on these blogs, and took to them like a sponge to puddle of unknown origin. After ~~abandoning~~ pivoting from a career as a fiction writer to a web developer, these sorts of resources spoke to me. It seemed like the perfect place to appease the writer inside of me as well as... you know... make money.

I was constantly thinking of what my break out article would be. Would I finally master TypeScript? Would I find the trickiest trick to end all tricks? What about a new HTML element? What about-

Well, the problem with thinking is that if that's all you do, you never *do* anything.

So when [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/author/andy-bell/) put out a call for writers to post to Piccalilli, I said screw it and wrote up an email with a pithy blog title that I thought up in a couple minutes and hit send before I could get in my own way.

With a generic thumbs up, I wrote up another 1500 words about the topic I pitched, and now, [I'm officially a web dev blogger/article writer/words type person](https://piccalil.li/blog/functional-custom-elements-the-easy-way/).

Granted, I have already blogged about web dev stuff on my own site so "official" is doing some heavy lifting.
