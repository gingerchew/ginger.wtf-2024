> War is hell? No, war is war and hell is hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse

> Exactly, there are no innocent bystanders in hell. War is chock full of them - children, old ladies, sick and infirmed. In fact, except for some of the brass, almost everybody involved is an innocent bystander.

Violence is apalling. There are few who are *in favor* of violence.

This is why so often these acts of violence are renamed. It's not an invasion, it's an insurgency. It's not war, it's a military operation. It's not a war crime, it's an interrogation method.

## Manufacturing Consent, or The War You Didn't Know You Approved

Looking back now, it is easy to say that the war in Iraq was unjustified. In 2001, it was wrong to even suggest that it wasn't justified. I can remember the headlines of Freedom Fries, Bin Laden's mountain fortress, and "the known knowns and the known unknowns".

To say otherwise was un-American. As more troops came home in coffins, photos of injustices committed by American soldiers began flooding in. Men, women, children. We were no better than "them." Then it was time to bring everyone home.

With our service members returning, the suicide rate among soldiers has skyrocketed. As of [June 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1009846329/military-suicides-deaths-mental-health-crisis), there has been more than 300,000 since 2001. 10 times more than the number of people killed in 9/11.

## Colonial Power, or Your Friend That Peaked In High School

For every straight line on a map, you can find the remnants of colonialism and the devastation it wrought. They were not countries, just spoils of war divvied up *fairly*.

Everyone else is just a bystander.

As a result, former colonies and countries in the global south are left to either fend for themselves or be under constant threat of meddling from global powers. Despite the dissolution of the colonial British Empire, colonies still exist under a different name.

Guam, Puerto Rico, both are called "territories." Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Mann, countries who have only recently started to try and regain their cultural identities.
