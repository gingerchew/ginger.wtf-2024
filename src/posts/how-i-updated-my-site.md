## It can be done.

I'm calling it. <mark>This is as done as it is going to get</mark>, so I'm just calling it.

*"Just build websites"* is the advice I'm following here. Well, that and "just press publish".

I could wait, for the next framework, the next language, the next whatever. But I don't need to.

## 100% done?

Eh, 98%? There is some performance stuff I'm not happy with (e.g. not 100's across the lighthouse board). But that is stuff I can do in my free time. 

## And that's supposed to be good enough?

It is, another piece of advice I heard was from a touring artist. "Give 90% 100% of the time". If you give 100% 100% of the time, you'll burn out, destroy your voice, and your tour will end a quarter of the way through. Give 90% consistently, and you're going to make it to the last gig.

With the power of static site generation and git powered hosting, I present `ginger.wtf`.
