I just want to start off by saying this is my _opinion_, and since it is my _opinion_ there is no reason to feel like our _opinions_ are inherently against each other. I also want to clarify this is just games I've played since the start of 2023, not that they are released in 2023.

## In no particular order,

I play an average amount of games, so I am going to list some of the games that I liked but not enough to put into a list.

- Pokemon: Scarlet
- Pokemon: Legends Arceus
- Unpacking
- Cities Skylines
- Starfield

## The real list

### Baldur's Gate

I mean it's the GOTY, so it pretty much has to be on the list.

Truly though, it is a really good game. If you have always wanted to do a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, then you should check this game out.

#### Why shouldn't you play this game?

If you don't like isometric games, you probably won't like this game. It isn't isometric, but the camera control is not the usual third person vs first person. The camera is independent of the player.

You can probably get yourself into a frustration loop if you don't read some of the tutorials thoroughly. Is this spell an action or a bonus action? What is an oath charge? What 

#### Why should you play this game?

I mean, its just a good game. The first 10 minutes tutorial/gameplay do an incredible job of explaining how to play the game. If you have ever wanted to play DnD but could never convince your friends, you could probably get them to play this game.

It has the "be whoever/play however you want to be" that I felt with skyrim, without the "Just play Stealth Archer" stigma. 

### Monster Hunter

I have already written about my confusion about the [Monster Hunter game play loop](https://ginger.wtf/posts/monster-hunter-gameplay-loop/).
