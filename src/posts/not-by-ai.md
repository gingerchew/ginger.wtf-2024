I was getting up to date on my RSS feed, and saw [this post by Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/24/not-by-ai/) about a sticker that would mark your site as "Not By AI".

## Will this work?

No, not really? Like there are plenty of signs in the world that people don't listen to.

There isn't anything behind this other than signing up. I'm not "supporting" a sticker.

## Would something _like_ this work?

I mean, no. It would start an arms race. Remember when a captcha was  4 letters, a number, and a line between them? Now we have to identify all the stop signs in an image.

I am also not thrilled by the fact that this website is asking for donations for a moderately well designed image?

[One which can be reasonably recreated using HTML and CSS.](https://codepen.io/gingerchew/full/RwvJqRe) using container queries/units.

{% include 'madeby.njk' %}

_Yeah yeah, mine doesn't smile I know._

I think there _should_ be some way to distinguish between AI generated content and "bespoke" human made content. I don't think an `.svg` and a donate link are gonna get us there.
