My name is ginger!

## What do you do?

I build apps and website. I play guitar and bass. I play video games.

## What have you done?

Mostly little one off websites to test out new tech/frameworks. For example, [top-level.dev](https://top-level.dev) is a project I made over the weekend to keep a handy list of TLDs available. [emotion.me](https://emotiome.netlify.app/), track your days to get an overview of how your mood changes. You can also check out [its-a-fruit.farm](https://its-a-fruit.farm) is an art project where fruit becomes webpages.

## How do you do it?

I have experience with a variety of frameworks, from Bootstrap to Vue and Astro, but have worked in PHP, Shopify, MODX, and WordPress.
