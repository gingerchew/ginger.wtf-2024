## My name is ginger!

## What do you do?

I build apps and websites. I play guitar and bass. I play video games.

## What have you done?

I work at an advertising agency building websites for multiple sectors, from finance to construction, as small as family owned and as large as nationwide. Mostly little one off websites to test out new tech/frameworks. For example, [top-level.dev](https://top-level.dev) is a project I made over the weekend to keep a handy list of TLDs available. [emotion.me](https://emotiome.netlify.app/), track your days to get an overview of how your mood changes. You can also check out [its-a-fruit.farm](https://its-a-fruit.farm) is an art project where fruit becomes webpages.

## How do you do it?

I have experience with a variety of frameworks, from Bootstrap to Vue and Astro, but am familiar with PHP, Shopify, MODX, and WordPress.
