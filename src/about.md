## My name is {% serifName %}!

I build apps and websites. I play guitar and bass. I play video games.

## What have you done?

I work at an advertising agency building websites for multiple sectors, from finance to construction. In my free time I make single purpose websites to test out new tech/frameworks. For example, [top-level.dev](https://top-level.dev) is a project I made over the weekend to keep a handy list of TLDs available. [emotio.me](https://emotiome.netlify.app/), track your days to get an overview of how your mood changes. You can also check out [its-a-fruit.farm](https://its-a-fruit.farm), an art project where fruit becomes webpages.

## How do you do it?

I have experience with a variety of frameworks, from Bootstrap to Vue and Astro, but am familiar with PHP, Shopify, MODX, and WordPress.
