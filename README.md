    - also maybe style sitemap? https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/#sitemap
- [ ] dynamic favicon using canvas and js
    - idea being that when the theme is updated, the colors are grabbed from the `:root` and applied to the png favicon
    - now the color/theme of the favicon can be dynamic, even with the arc theme select component
