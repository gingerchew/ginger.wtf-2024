**TODO**

- [x] featured post
- [x] some sort of sticker component to add on titles
- [x] fix tag urls https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/
- [ ] Some sort of highlight component, ~~blockquote~~, side comment
- [ ] Theme chooser (in progress)
- [ ] edge function to make theme color not flash on dark mode (in progress)
- [ ] Group/Consolidate the indie web things more sanely
- [ ] Web mentions set up / plugin?
- [ ] style rss feed
    - https://jonchristopher.us/blog/beginning-to-style-your-rss-feed/
- [ ] dynamic favicon using canvas and js
    - idea being that when the theme is updated, the colors are grabbed from the `:root` and applied to the png favicon
    - now the color/theme of the favicon can be dynamic, even with the arc theme select component
    - *__PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DOCUMENT THIS ITS SUCH A GOOD IDEA__*
